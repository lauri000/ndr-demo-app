# Parity Matrix

Status tracking for the shared Iris Chat workspace.

Legend:

- `Done`: implemented and verified locally

## Current Notes

- The repo is structured as `core/`, `android/`, and `ios/`, with protocol
  crates vendored under `core/vendor/`.
- Android and iOS both consume the same UniFFI surface from `core/`.
- The device approval QR format is owned by `core/` and generated into both
  native clients.
- `just qa-native-contract` is green locally and is the blocking gate before
  Rust-core refactors.
- `just qa-interop` is the heavier, non-blocking confidence lane for mixed
  relay-backed flows.
- The mixed Android+iOS matrix currently succeeds locally for direct-chat
  transport and mixed group messaging in both creator directions.
